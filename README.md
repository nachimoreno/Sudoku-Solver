# Sudoku Solver

A Python-based Sudoku solver. This project provides a structured way to represent Sudoku boards, validate their state, and solve them using various algorithms.

## Algorithms

- **Naked Singles**: Places numbers where only one candidate remains for a cell.
- **Hidden Singles**: Places numbers where a candidate is the only one remaining for a row, column, or grid.
- *Planned*: Hidden pairs/triples, naked pairs/triples, and more advanced techniques.
